# Kotlin-Database-Query-Implementation
This builds on the Front end implementation program that was in the previous repository, and adds database querying into the application. The app queries TMDB to get upcoming and popular movies, as well as popular actors/actresses and obtains information about each category as well. It then uses recycler views to show this information in the front end of the application in an easy to view format.

## Running 
- Open Android Studio and import the project once you have it cloned. 
- Either look at the code or pack it into an apk or run it on an AVD
